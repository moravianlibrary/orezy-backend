# SmartCrop

SmartCrop serves as the backend for the web application Cropilot. It provides automated document processing capabilities that detect page boundaries and correct orientation. The service exposes an API used by the frontend and orchestrates a machine learning pipeline that analyzes uploaded images, identifies page coordinates, and applies rotation correction when needed.


## Application structure

The application is designed as a modular service combining a FastAPI interface, a background task queue, and a set of fine-tuned deep learning models. Image processing tasks are executed asynchronously through a worker system, enabling scalable and efficient handling of large batches of documents while storing metadata and processing results in MongoDB. Application is arranged into following modules:

- **api**: FastAPI routers for integration control and frontend.
- **core**: Contains a finetuned YOLO model for page coordinate detection and a ResNET-based rotation model for skew correction.
- **db**: MongoDB collections defined with Pydantic and related Mongo queries.
- **tasks**: Hatchet task queue and worker. Contains tasks performing the ML pipeline.

# Deployment

The project is built using uv and package-managed by ruff. Each instance is containerized into Docker containers. This repo offers 2 types of deployment:

## Local

To run your application locally, use docker-compose.hatchet-local.yml. Prerequisites of running app locally include setting up your MongoDB instance (e.g. on https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-database) and creating .env file. Your environment file should have this structure:

.env
```
MONGODB_URI = Url to your MongoDB instance
MONGODB_PASS = Create your DB password
MONGODB_DB = DB name
ENABLE_TLS = true

SCANS_VOLUME_PATH = Local directory path where new images will be uploaded via API
RETRAIN_VLUME_PATH = Local directory where images marked for retraining will be saved
MODELS_VLUME_PATH = Local directory for storing ML models.

HATCHET_CLIENT_TLS_STRATEGY = none
HATCHET_CLIENT_TOKEN = Hatchet token. Can be acessed via Hatchet web instance, or created with generate-worker-env.sh

PWD_SECRET = JWT secret used to compare credentials
ADMIN_EMAIL = Your login username for the API
ADMIN_PASSWORD = Your login password for the API
ADMIN_NAME = Name of the user
```

Then, run the application in following steps:

- `docker-compose -f docker-compose.hatchet-local.yml up -d` Start required services (Hatchet server, PostgreSQL and RabbitMQ as Hatchet backend)
- `uv run --env-file .env fastapi dev`  Start API locally, Swagger UI will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
- `uv run --env-file .env -m app.tasks.worker`  Start worker locally. The UI is available at http://127.0.0.1:8888/

## Production

The production version is stored in docker-compose.yml, and uses 3 environment files in total, which need to be set accordingly:

- *.env*: A password file. Create this file from .env.example, replace with your generated passwords. You will be regularly using WEBAPP_TOKEN variable for communication with API, the rest is internal to the application.
- *.admin-user-env*: Default login credentials for Hatchet UI and Cropilot. Create it from .admin-user-env.example.
- *.worker-env*: Contains a JWT token obtained from Hatchet. Generate the file by running `bash generate-worker-env.sh`.

Inside docker compose itself, there are 3 volumes which need to be set: retrain, upload and models volume. The related env. and build variables then need to point to this location (SCANS_VOLUME_PATH, RETRAIN_VOLUME_PATH, MODELS_VOLUME_PATH)

Finally, run the application with:

- `docker-compose up -d` Start all services (Hatchet server, PostgreSQL and RabbitMQ as Hatchet backend, MongoDB, API, and worker). API endpoints will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs , Hatchet UI at http://127.0.0.1:8888/ ,
and web UI at http://127.0.0.1:1234.


# Development

Development cheat sheet:

- `uvx ruff format . && uvx ruff check --fix .`  Format the project and fix linter errors
- `uv run pytest -v` Run tests
